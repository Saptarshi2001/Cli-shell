# Cshell
Cshell is a shell written in C to recreate the unix experience.It allows one to:-

- Change directories
- Create directories
- Extract contents from a file
- Echo text to the console
- Change the background and the foreground color of the terminal 

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Compile the main file by running the following the command : `gcc -o grp grp.c`
3. After compiling the files, run the executable:`grp.exe`   


## Usage

Compile the shell.c with gcc as - `gcc -o shell shell.c`
Run the executable `shell.exe`

Once the program is running, you can enter commands in the shell prompt. Here are some examples:

- Changing the directory
- Creating the directory
- Extracting the contents of a file
- Echo content to the console
- Changing the color
- Exit the shell
- help for getting a list of the commands

## System requirements
- Windows 7 or higher
- linux
- Gcc compiler

## Roadmap
- Adding a compression tool to the shell
- Implementing the grep command
- Integrating it with Gcc such that it can run C programs
- Allowing the usage of pipes (|)
